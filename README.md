Special Weather Statement
=================
...Dense Fog along the Lake Michigan Shore this Evening... Fog over Lake Michigan will continue to move onto shoreline areas in Illinois this evening, resulting in periods of dense fog along the immediate shoreline. Fog will continue to spread inland, with briefly dense fog possible. The fog may gradually diminish from north to south by the early overnight hours. Be prepared for rapidly changing visibility near the shore through the remainder of this evening.
